## Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), has become ubiquitous since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022. AI finds applications across numerous tasks such as conversing with humans, providing personalised recommendations, analysing medical images, autonomously driving cars, and completing code and scripts, to name a few. However, what is commonly referred to as "AI," and what are its current limitations? In this workshop, we will provide an intuitive introduction to AI's inner workings using hands-on exercises to understand what AI is all about. We will begin with an intuitive review of the conceptual foundation of modern AI - the idea that neural networks can approximate any mathematical function. We will then discuss why having assumptions or pre-existing knowledge can help with efficient learning and generalisation, before concluding the workshop with our own language model implementation. Our aim is to pique your interest in AI and to provide insight into its current strengths and limitations.
